01. Installation and Setup
--------------------------

Installing angular: npm install -g @angular/cli

new project: ng new ng5 --style=scss --routing

to start: ng serve

02. Components
-------------

Components: building Blocks
Structured in 3 different sections
1. Import: 
2. Decorator: specify different properties that help define structure of components(selector, templateUrl, style)
3. export class components:

new component:
ng generate component home
ng g c about

app.component.html
Contains current default view

03. Templating & Styling
-----------------------

inline comments using template in ts file: styles:

Appending styles

04. Interpolation, Property & Event Binding
-------------------------------------------

View is built but no logic is embedded, to make it function using prop n event binding

Interpolation: Making the communication possible from component to view(one direction)
same: value="{{btnText}}" or [value]="btnText"

Two way data binding:ng model

import formsModule
  goalText: string = 'My first life goal';
  <input type="text" class="txt" name="item" placeholder="Life goal..."[(ngModel)]="goalText">
  <br /> <span>{{goalText}}</span>

Now we are making it bi directional
from component view is rendered as 'My first life goal'
and based on changes made in view, component is changing spontaneously

Event Binding:
when we wish to save particular input
clickEvent: 

Now lets display whatever data is pushed.
    <p class="life-container" *ngFor="let randomGoal of goals">{{randomGoal}}</p>


05. Animation
-------------

install/import: npm install @angular/animations@latest --save

Add BrowserAnimationsModule

05. Routing
-----------

Add components in app-routing.module.ts and we'll be able to navigate between Home and About pages

Done: Hit http://localhost:4200/about/727682 

Retrieving above 727682 value from query param
Use ActivatedRoute, dependency Injection

  constructor(private route: ActivatedRoute) {
    this.route.params.subscribe(res => console.log('Bingo!! We were successfully able to retrieve value from query parameter: ' +res.id));
  }

Component based router navigation:
import router library
and set link, we'll be able to nevigate between component


07. Services
------------
services files:
Access code across multiple components: 
for making http calls
for sharing data between components

ng generate service data

write service in newly generated data.service.ts
import it in module and then home component and create instance(DI) in constructor

08. Deployment
--------------
build: CLI - ng build - check vendor.js [Bulky]
ng build --prod : Check size of vendor.js
ng build --prod --base-href="url/to/path"

using github pages: npm install -g angular-cli-ghpages

build codebase which is in github: ng build --prod --base-href="url/to/github/repo"
angular-cli-ghpages
