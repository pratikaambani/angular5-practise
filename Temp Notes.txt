Angular 5 Course:

01. Installation and Setup
--------------------------

Installing angular: npm install -g @angular/cli

new project: ng new ng5 --style=scss --routing

to start: ng serve

02. Components
-------------

Components: building Blocks
Structured in 3 different sections
1. Import: 
2. Decorator: specify different properties that help define structure of components(selector, templateUrl, style)
3. export class components:

new component:
ng generate component home
ng g c about

app.component.html
Contains current default view

03. Templating & Styling
-----------------------

inline comments using template in ts file: styles:

Appending styles

04. Interpolation, Property & Event Binding
-------------------------------------------

View is built but no logic is embedded, to make it function using prop n event binding

Interpolation: Making the communication possible from component to view(one direction)
same: value="{{btnText}}" or [value]="btnText"

Two way data binding:ng model

import formsModule
  goalText: string = 'My first life goal';
  <input type="text" class="txt" name="item" placeholder="Life goal..."[(ngModel)]="goalText">
  <br /> <span>{{goalText}}</span>

Now we are making it bi directional
from component view is rendered as 'My first life goal'
and based on changes made in view, component is changing spontaneously

Event Binding:
when we wish to save particular input
clickEvent:
